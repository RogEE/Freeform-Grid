freeform_grid
=============

This is a prototype Grid fieldtype for Freeform Pro. Still in development / use with caution!

It allows you to create a table field with variable number of labeled columns. On the front-end, the rendered field includes controls for adding and removing rows in the table. You can also choose to show the fields separatly rather than in a table.

(n.b. This Fieldtype is for use with Solspace Freeform, not for use as a Custom Channel Field.)
